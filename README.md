Obviously, not all the courses are found here. I'll be here until Feb '22. If you want to provide the other courses too, feel free to contact me and I'll add you as a collaborator.

## Collaborating

**Sharing is caring**! If you feel like your notes could be here, please contact me: I'll add you as a collaborator.

## Tips

- You can use `[\w_\*] \$[^$]+\$` to look for non-rendered LaTeX expressions
- You can use [this extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MeowTeam.vscode-math-to-image) to render LaTeX expressions in markdown

## How to contact me

Send me an email at me @ my website's domain, or contact me on [Telegram](https://t.me/simmy) (please state that you're from the Vrije course as I receive lots of spam).
