# Exercise 1

We know that $lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} s_n = \frac{1}{1-x}$.

- $\frac{1}{1-\frac{3}{4}} = 4$
- $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n}$ $2 + 0 \beta + 2 \beta^2 + 0\beta^3+2\beta^4$ $\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} 2 * \beta^{2*i}=\frac{32}{7}$
- $\sum_{n=0}^{n\le100} \beta^n$ = $s_n = \frac{1-x^{n+1}}{1-x}$  
- $\sum_{n=100}^{\infty} \beta^n$

# Exercise 2

First, we write down the base cases:

$V_t(s) = 0$ meaning that our destination is our destinatino

$V_0(x)=\infty$ meaning that $x$ cannot be reached in 0 steps

Then we have a recursion step:

$V_{t+1} (x) = min \{d(x,y) + V_t(y)\}$ saying that if I have $t+1$ timesteps, and I want to reach some node $x$ it's similar to the distance from $x$ to $y$ and the distance that is needed in $y$.

Using this, we make a DP table step by step.

The table has the number of steps on the X axis, and states in Y axis.

Next, we use recursion to fill in the rest of the table. 

We fill in the distances to reach the destination in ONE STEP on time t=1.

You know you can stop with two different conditions: 

- the last column doesn't change anymore (you cannot improve your solution by adding one step);
- t is as big as the number of nodes in your graph.
