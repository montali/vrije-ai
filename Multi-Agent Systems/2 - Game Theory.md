# Game theory

This is one of the fundamental ideas behind MAS. We're first going to look at examples of interesting games, and we'll look at basic concepts for solving these. 

## Games

We all know **games**, used as entertainment or challenge, which though can also be used as **models**. All the models are wrong (in the sense that they're simplifications), but some of them are useful!

Game theory started as an **economic theory**, and in the meantime lots of nobel prizes have been won for it. Game theory provides a good level of abstraction for the study of socio-economic, political and biological phenomena. 

The ingredients are the following: **players** (usually having opponents, either other agents, versions of yourself or even *chance events*), **rules** (certain actions cannot be done, others yes, resulting in a *payoff* or *utility*). Everyone wants to **maximize their pay-off**. There are two flavours, one being *non-cooperative* (you have selfish individuals, which are only concerned with their own utility, which may still result in accidental cooperation with self-enforcing agreements) or *cooperative* (they bind contracts for collaboration, counting on them). We can further divide this category into *non-trasferable utility* (the pay-off for each individual increases) and *transferable utility* (needing a fair way tl divide the additional value). The ***Shapley value*** captures this idea of *fair distribution*. 

There are simple ways of representing utility, like matrices, decision trees... 

Generally, **utility** is a **function of the joint action** of players, i.e. a function mapping actions to rewards.

The **ultimatum game** is an interesting example: player A can choose any fraction 0<x<1, and B either accepts (getting 1-x) or rejects (both get 0). This explains rationality vs emotionality: a rational agent always accepts.

Let's look at a few non-trivial examples of games.

### Economy: Cournot's Duopoly model

You have 2 companies making an interchangeable product (AH muesli vs Jumbo muesli). Withouth knowing the other company's strategy, both need to determine the quantity they need to produce. The unit price depends on the total produced quantity: if there's more in the market, the price goes down. The unit price, therefore, is given by $p(q_1, q_2) = \alpha - \beta (q_1+q_2)$.

Suppose they can produce these at a unit cost of $c_1$ and $c_2$ respectively, which quantity should they produce to maximize the profit?

### Children dividing pie

This illustrates various GT concepts. One cuts the cake, the other one makes the first choice. This is a minimax and maximin problem: the cutter will mitigate the worst result, while the chooser will maximize his pay-off. This is sometimes called *reversed game theory*: you start from the desired output, and you derive what you'll want to lose.

### Prisoner's dilemma

### Penalty kick game

Studied extensively in sports literature, if the kicker kicks a penalty the goalkeeper doesn't have time and he just has to **guess** the direction. 

### Ice cream time

Suppose you have a long beach, and two ice cream vendors: where should they park their store to have more customers? The best choice is actually putting them both in the center: this is known as *Hotelling game*, and it's seen in politics too. USA president candidates are actually centrists for this reason. 

### Partnership game

Suppose you've got 2 students working on a project, getting the same grade. Each student must decide how much effort to put into the project: the reward is the sum of these, and a sinergy term capturing the added value generated by working together $r = 4(s_1+s_2+bs_1s_2)$. The cost is $s_i^2$, increasing quadratically. 

### Selfish routing in congestion games

Suppose you have two cities, starting and termination point, and there are two roads. The cost/utility increases with the number of people that choose a road, while for the other it is constant at $1$. Everyone will choose the second hoping for a time that's less than an hour. This is linked to the **price of anarchy**: if someone told you which road to use, the average will be 3/4. The liberty of choosing makes the average 4/3.
