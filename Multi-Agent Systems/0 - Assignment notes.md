The first question is about a two-layer game with a utility table. The first question is about dominated strategy/, and secondly there's a question about best response dynamic (imagine it's not played simultaneously) giving you some idea about equilibrium. 

The second problem is about dominated strategies: imagine you have a game in which everyone writes a number bewtween 1 and 100 without consulting the neighbours, and we compute the AVG, the person who's closest to 2/3 of the mean wins. Think about the best strategy. 

Thw third question, we've already discussed this type of problem: it's about two companies making the same item, and they want to decide the quantity to produce. Once fixed, they cannot change it. The idea is that the market price depends on the produced quantity, and the price that you get for unit is given by the mentioned equation. 

What could happen if you could run this sequantially rather than simultaneously? One company decides, and the other knows and decides, then the other changes, and so on until the equilibrium.
