# Eye tracking

Despite what many people think, **eye tracking** is a very complex measure. There's actually a very long history of search in the eye tracking field.

**Saccades** are the most important eye movements, the fastest of human movements.

We can see that the **fovea** is located in the _Macula_, and our blind spot is found near the optic disc. The light has to actually travel a lot before hitting the retina and producing a signal.

The outer surface is the **cornea**, the **pupil** is the darker one, the _white thingie_ is called Sclera (protein giving the eye shape), and the inside is filled with _vitreous humour_, a transparent type of liquid. It's important to know that the **fovea** is extremely small (1-1.5ยบ of angle) and it contains higher density cones. You have to make an eye movement and focus the fovea on the relevant object.

We were talking about _degrees of visual angle_: we can measure objects using the _metric system_, but it depends on the distance. Closer objects need more space in our field of view. We can capture that by computing the angle, being approximately the ratio between object size and distance.

One degree of visual angle is one centimeter object sitting at 57 cm of distance. This means that we can focus on objects that occupy the same space as a 1cm object sitting at 57cm from us.

So, what is actually happening during eye movements? We **don't really see much**: these are really fast, and there are even some mechanisms suggesting that we're suppressing information to avoid distraction. Flashes presented during eye movements were ignored during a **saccade**.

There are actually **different types of eye movements**:

- **Tremor**: basically noise in your muscle control, having high frequency. It is not related to information processing;
- **Drift**: very slow movements while you're fixating a target. Not that informative but may be annoying;
- **Vergence eye movement**: eye movements that direct the eyes towards each other or parallelly to read out depth;
- **Vestibular-ocular reflex**: correcting for head movements, when we're moving our head, our eyes keep go on the other way;
- **Optokinetic reflex**: combination of smooth pursuit (happens when we're looking at moving objects) and saccade (quickly redirecting back). Happens when you're on a train and you look outside;
- **Microsaccades**: kind of like saccades, basically the same but on smaller scale. Happens when, for example, you ask participants to keep the eyes still, and they're not;
- **Saccades**: already talked about that :)

If you look at this, microsaccades cause the movement of the _snakes_, but if you really concentrate on focusing on the black dot, they **stop**.

Our vision is definitely **not passive**: you have to make eye movements in order to see and actively extract information.
With saccades we saw that if you're not fixated at something, you miss information. Even covert attention is active (microsaccades are happening, you're never really completely fixed on something). Some experiments have shown that by stabilizing the eye (using some poison) to avoid every type of movements, the images **fade**.

All of this shows that **visual perception is really critical to our information processing**.
