# Evolutionary computing - intro

- As already seen, AI can be split into **digital AI** and **embodied AI**. 

### Material

Use **Canvas**, the coursebook which was written by J.E. Smith and Eiben, the lessons recorded last year. Papers are not really needed for the exam (but may be useful?). Lessons have 1-to-1 correspondence to the chapters.

### Grading

The grade is the 50/50 average of the written exam and the practical assignment. Both of them have to be >5.5.

### Practical assignment

There can be two types, **standard groups** and **advanced groups** (which, together with the prof's staff, will do research). From this year on, **for each report** every student will have to state his/her **contribution**. This avoids freeriders. 

Do not copy stuff from other teams: you will be reported and shit will happen.

### Schedule

The course is **hybrid** with virtual lectures and physical Q&A. 

### Communication

Use **Canvas** and **not emails**!

## Research project

Programming skills and software engineering skills are definitely needed. Experience with robot hardware is useful for one of the projects.
